I downloaded an LS Customs script that has a GTA Online style menu and it is very outdated however I have chose to update a lot of the options myself and I have now become stuck with what to do to fix some of these issues. 

## ADDED BY ME
- Added Utility paintjobs.
- Added Worn paintjobs.
- Added Chameleon paintjobs.
- Added any missing Wheels.
- Added Track Wheels.
- Added Street Wheels.
- Added Race Wheels (F1).
- Added Benny's Bespoke Wheels.
- Added Benny's Originals Wheels.
- Added Chrome Wheels.
- Added 250+ Custom Wheels.
- Fixed every typo error.

## NEED HELP WITH
- Adding submenus to wheels so I have the option of stock and chrome instead of them all being in 1 submenu
- Adding missing modifications for vehicles. (side panels, mirrors etc)
- Adding neon coloured headlights.
- Adding missing neon layouts (I have front, back and sides however I want the individual options like front or back or sides)
- Adding low grip tire option
- Adding tire designs (custom tires)
- Tire smokes not working
- Bulletproof tires not working

So yeah i've left the download below aswell as an image of the menu itself, I just really need someone who can help as I know it's probably simple to some. I have sat here for days now fixing issues for this and im now stuck on probably the easiest part lol, any help would be much appreciated, thanks!
